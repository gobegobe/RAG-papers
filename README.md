# RAG-papers
Advanced papers of Retrieval-Agumented Generation (RAG).



## Prompt Route

(1) Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models with Iterative Retrieval-Generation Synergy 

- EMNLP 2023, findings
- Through iteration of retrieval and augmention



(2) Self-Knowledge Guided Retrieval Augmentation for Large Language Models

- EMNLP 2024, findings
- Core idea : classify user queries between "model knows" and "need more knowledge", call retrieval just for the latter type.



## Improve Retriever

(1) Interleaving Retrieval with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Knowledge-Intensive Multi-Step Questions

- ACL 2023, long paper
- Introduce another sub-system (including a LM) to help retriever get better documents



## New module / framework

(1) Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection

- ICLR 2024
